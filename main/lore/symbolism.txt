Wisdom and Intelligence: The large elephant head represents supreme wisdom, intelligence, and a discriminating intellect essential for attaining perfection and success in life.

Clear Thinking: Elephants are known for their memory and calmness, symbolizing deep understanding and tranquility necessary for spiritual progress.

The elephant head also represents Atman (the soul) in contrast to the human body symbolizing Maya (illusion), highlighting the spiritual (self) dissolving the illusion of the physical world.

It represents Om (Aum), the cosmic sound and reality.

5. Broken Tusk (One Tusk)
Overcoming Duality: The single tusk symbolizes retaining good while discarding bad; it represents the triumph of wisdom over ego and impurity.

It also represents sacrifice; Ganesha broke his tusk to write the Mahabharata, indicating the importance of devotion and sacrifice in gaining knowledge.

6. Large Belly
Cosmic Universe and Patience: The large belly symbolizes the ability to digest all experiences in life—pleasant and unpleasant—with equanimity.

It represents the entire created universe—the seven realms above and below.

The belly also contains the cosmic energy (kundalini), often symbolized by a snake around Ganesha’s waist.
