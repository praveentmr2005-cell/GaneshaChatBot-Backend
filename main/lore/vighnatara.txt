Lord Ganesha’s role as the remover of obstacles (Vighnaharta) is deeply embedded in Hindu tradition and is elaborated in various ancient texts and Puranas. Below is a detailed summary drawn from original and authoritative sources:

The Title Vighnaharta: Lord of Obstacles
Ganesha is revered as Vighnaharta, meaning "Remover of Obstacles," or "Lord of obstacles." In this capacity, he is invoked at the start of any new venture or ceremony to ensure success by removing both material and spiritual impediments. The title is derived from Sanskrit—Vighna meaning obstacles, and Harta meaning remover or destroyer.

His role is dual: he not only removes obstacles but can also place obstacles in the path of those whose intentions or actions call for checks and balance, thus maintaining cosmic order (dharma).

The Shiva Purana and other texts describe Ganesha as the chief of the ganas (attendants of Shiva), entrusted with the responsibility of clearing the path for auspicious undertakings and devotion.

Scriptural References on Ganesha as Vighnaharta
The Ganesha Purana (a key text dedicated exclusively to Ganesha) extensively praises him as the remover of obstacles who governs material and spiritual realms, blessing devotees with success and protection.

In the Skanda Purana, devotees are advised to worship Ganesha first before beginning any ritual, journey, or task, highlighting his importance in avoiding delays and difficulties.

The Mudgala Purana explains that Ganesha controls obstacles created by other powerful forces and ensures a smooth progress in all domains—personal, social, and cosmic.

The Shiva Mahapurana recounts episodes where Ganesha defeats demons who personify obstacles and difficulties, symbolizing conquest over negativity and ignorance.

Symbolic Meaning of Obstacle Removal
Material Obstacles: Physical hindrances in life such as delays, financial issues, health problems, and opposition.

Spiritual Obstacles: Inner barriers like ignorance, ego, attachment, and distractions on the path of spiritual growth.

Ganesha’s large elephant head symbolizes wisdom and strength needed to overcome challenges.

His big ears signify the ability to listen carefully and attend to prayers.

The broken tusk represents sacrifice and the triumph of knowledge over ego and imperfection.

His mouse vehicle symbolizes humility, small desires, and overcoming even the tiniest obstacles.

Ritual and Devotional Context
Devotees chant mantras like "Om Gam Ganapataye Namaha" to invoke his energy before embarking on significant activities such as starting a business, undertaking journeys, or beginning studies.

He is also considered the Lord of Beginnings, and his blessings are sought to ensure that efforts bear fruit without obstruction.

Philosophical Interpretations
Paul Courtright, a scholar of Indian religions, notes that Ganesha's dharma (cosmic role) is not only to remove obstacles but also at times to create them to teach lessons or maintain cosmic justice.

Krishan highlights that Ganesha’s dual role as both "Vighnakartā" (creator of obstacles) and "Vighnahartā" (remover of obstacles) reflects the complex nature of challenges in life—sometimes obstacles are necessary for growth, and sometimes they must be removed.

In summary, Lord Ganesha as Vighnaharta acts as the divine guardian and facilitator who grants success by clearing both physical and metaphysical barriers, embodying wisdom, compassion, and balance.
