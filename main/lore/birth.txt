Birth of Lord Ganesha
Once, on the sacred Mount Kailash, Goddess Parvati decided to take a bath. She was the supreme divine mother energy—Parashakti, the original creative force residing as the Kundalini energy in each being’s root chakra (Muladhara). Not wanting to be disturbed, she instructed Nandi, the loyal bull and attendant of Lord Shiva, to guard the door and prevent anyone from entering while she bathed.

Nandi, whose devotion was primarily to Lord Shiva, took up his guard duty. But when Shiva returned home, Nandi, prioritizing his loyalty to Shiva over Parvati's orders, allowed him inside. Parvati was angered that Nandi, unlike her own loyal servant, showed allegiance to Shiva instead. Wanting someone truly devoted to her, she created a boy out of the turmeric paste (saffron-colored) from her own body, breathing life into this form.

The boy was none other than Ganesha. Parvati declared him her loyal son and had him stand guard at her door the next time she bathed, instructing him to not let anyone in.

Conflict Between Shiva and Ganesha
As fate would have it, Shiva arrived while Parvati was bathing. Ganesha, loyally following his mother's command, stopped Shiva from entering. Shiva, irritated and unfamiliar with this strange boy barring his path, ordered his troops and attendants to remove Ganesha. However, each attempt failed—the boy was endowed with formidable strength and divine power granted by Parvati herself.

Seeing no other way and acting in divine fury, Shiva himself engaged in battle with Ganesha. In his wrath, he used his trident to sever Ganesha’s head, killing him instantly. Parvati emerged and was overwhelmed with grief and rage upon seeing her son's lifeless body. She transformed into the fierce form of Kali and threatened to destroy the entire creation in her sorrow and anger.

This cosmic upset alarmed the creator god Brahma and other deities, who pleaded with Parvati to stay her hand. She agreed but set two conditions: first, that Ganesha must be brought back to life, and second, that he henceforth be worshipped before all other gods as the foremost deity.

The Elephant Head
Lord Shiva, remorseful and calm, accepted these terms but explained that it was impossible to restore Ganesha to his original form because the trident's divine blow could not be reversed. He ordered his followers to fetch the head of the first living creature they found lying with its head facing north.

After a search, they found an elephant calf. Shiva brought back the elephant’s head and placed it on Ganesha's body. He then breathed life into the child, restoring him to life with new divine form and strength. Shiva declared Ganesha both as his son and Parvati’s, naming him Ganapati, the lord of the ganas or celestial attendants.

He blessed Ganesha as the remover of obstacles and the god to be worshipped at the beginning of all endeavors. Ganesha then took his place as the leader of the spiritual forces and the embodiment of wisdom and auspicious beginnings.

Symbolism and Inner Meaning
Beyond the literal story, this myth carries profound metaphysical implications:

Parvati represents the primordial energy of creation, the power within all living beings known as Kundalini.

Ganesha’s creation from turmeric paste symbolizes the manifesting of consciousness from purified matter or body energy.

Ganesha’s guarding the door signifies the ego or limited self that blocks the unfettered access to divine consciousness.

Shiva’s destruction of Ganesha’s head reflects the need to destroy the ego to make way for higher spiritual wisdom.

The elephant head symbolizes supreme wisdom, strength, and discriminating intellect beyond mere human understanding. The large ears teach attentive listening; the small eyes denote focused vision; the powerful trunk represents adaptability and efficacy.

Ganesha’s single tusk (one whole and one broken) embodies the balance of retaining truth while discarding ignorance.

This story is thus seen as a metaphor for the spiritual journey — the destruction of ego-bound identity and the birth of enlightened wisdom that can remove obstacles on the path to spiritual realization
